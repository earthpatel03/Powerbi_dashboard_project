I build a Power BI Healthcare Dashboard Project .
This project helps track and analyze key healthcare metrics such as total patients, inpatients, outpatients, staff ratio, ER time, and treatment cost.
It provides deep insights into patient demographics, admission & discharge trends, ICU usage, and mortality rates.

The dashboard also covers revenue analysis by age group, feedback ratings, and bed occupancy for better hospital performance monitoring.
 With interactive drill-through features, it allows detailed analysis of patient-level records.

This project highlights how data visualization in Power BI can improve decision-making and healthcare outcomes.
